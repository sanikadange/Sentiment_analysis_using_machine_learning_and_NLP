The **Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning and NLP** project analyzes customer feedback by breaking it into distinct aspects, identifying sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral) for each. It uses **NLP tools** like VADER and TextBlob for sentiment analysis and **machine learning** for precise predictions. The frontend, built with **Streamlit**, provides an interactive interface and also offers recommendations for purchasing decisions. This project helps businesses understand customer preferences, improve product features, and enhance customer satisfaction.
